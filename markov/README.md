Chapter 3: Markov
=================

The Markov composing code creates new music based on an Markovian analysis of music events. The analytical code for markov chains takes these events and produces a logical state transition matrix from the succession orders of their pitches. 

This version is quite simple and uses only the diatonic c-major scale as data; however, with little modification, this code can analyze using any diatonic or chromatic input.
